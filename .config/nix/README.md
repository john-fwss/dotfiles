# Nix Config
---

A flake for john's system config.

---

If you just did a fresh system install of nix, you'll have to replace this hardware-configuration.nix with the one from your /etc/nixos folder.
Also make sure the user defined in users.nix is set to the user you created during the initial install.

Or you'll irreparably brick your system to a state where you can't even rollback.
Ask me how I know.
